# kmb172_p4

This package defines a urdf file which extends the minimal robot from class to have three limbs and two joints. The file defining this robot is called kmb172_robot_p4.urdf

It also provides two new source files: kmb172_minimal_joint_controller.cpp, and kmb172_sin_commander.cp

The first extends the minimal joint controller to control both of my robot's joints. The second publishes two different user defined sinusoidal signals which the joint controller uses as desired position commands for its joints.
